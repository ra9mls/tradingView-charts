# Updates v1.4.0 - Strategies Multi-Interval Comparison Tool

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Added a complete Strategies tool for comparing multiple trading strategies with different intervals on a single chart. All strategies start from Y=0 baseline showing percentage changes, with color-coded profit/loss indicators and historical average line.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Navigation Toggle Between Tools

**Implementation:**
Added navigation buttons to switch between "Price Chart" and "Strategies" views.

**UI:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Solana Token Price Chart  [Price Chart] [Strategies]  ☀/🌙 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Files Modified:**
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx)
  - Added `ViewMode` type: `"chart" | "strategies"`
  - Added state: `const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<ViewMode>("chart")`
  - Created toggle buttons with conditional rendering

---

### 2. Strategies View Component

**Purpose:** Allow users to build and compare multiple trading strategies for a single token with different intervals.

**Features:**
- Token selector (reuses TokenSearchModal with 200+ tokens)
- Time range presets (1D, 7D, 1M, 3M, 1Y, Custom)
- Interval selector (1m, 5m, 1h, 4h, 6h, 1D, 3D, 1W)
- Signal type selector (LONG/SHORT)
- Add Strategy button with loading state
- Strategy list with color indicators and profit/loss display
- Remove individual strategies or Clear All
- Real-time profit/loss calculation
- Full dark mode support

**File:** [components/StrategiesView.tsx](components/StrategiesView.tsx) (NEW - 500+ lines)

**Strategy Interface:**
```typescript
type SignalType = "LONG" | "SHORT";

interface Strategy {
  id: string;
  interval: Interval;
  signal: SignalType;
  data: TokenPriceData[];
  color: string;
  profit: number;
}
```

---

### 3. Strategy Chart Component with Y=0 Baseline

**Purpose:** Display all strategies on a single chart starting from Y=0 coordinate, showing percentage changes from entry price.

**Key Features:**

#### A. Y=0 Baseline
All strategies start from Y=0, displaying percentage change from entry price:
- Positive percentage = profit
- Negative percentage = loss
- Dashed gray line at Y=0 for reference

#### B. Color Logic
**LONG Signal:**
- Green line if `final price > initial price` (profit)
- Red line if `final price < initial price` (loss)

**SHORT Signal:**
- Green line if `final price < initial price` (profit on short)
- Red line if `final price > initial price` (loss on short)
- Graph still drawn in upper Y coordinate (absolute percentage)

#### C. Historical Average Line
- Blue line (`#3b82f6`)
- Calculates average of all strategy performance at each timestamp
- Line width: 3px (thicker than strategy lines)
- Also starts from Y=0

#### D. Calculation Formula
```typescript
// For LONG:
percentChange = ((currentPrice - firstPrice) / firstPrice) * 100;

// For SHORT (inverted logic):
percentChange = ((firstPrice - currentPrice) / firstPrice) * 100;
```

**File:** [components/StrategyChart.tsx](components/StrategyChart.tsx) (NEW - 250+ lines)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses TradingView Lightweight Charts
- Creates separate line series for each strategy
- Transforms price data to percentage changes
- Adds Y=0 baseline as dashed line
- Calculates and displays historical average
- Responsive to theme changes
- Auto-scales to fit all strategies

## 📊 How It Works

### Adding a Strategy

1. **Select Token**
   - Click token dropdown
   - Search by symbol or address
   - Select token from list

2. **Set Time Range**
   - Click preset (1D, 7D, 1M, 3M, 1Y)
   - Or select Custom with date pickers

3. **Choose Interval**
   - Select from: 1m, 5m, 1h, 4h, 6h, 1D, 3D, 1W

4. **Select Signal Type**
   - **LONG**: Betting price will increase
   - **SHORT**: Betting price will decrease

5. **Add Strategy**
   - Click "Add Strategy" button
   - Strategy fetches data and calculates profit/loss
   - Automatically assigned a color (green or red based on performance)
   - Appears in strategy list and chart

### Strategy List Display

Each strategy shows:
```
[Color Box] 1h LONG  +3.25%  [×]
           ↑    ↑      ↑      ↑
        color  signal profit remove
```

- **Color indicator**: Visual representation of strategy line color
- **Interval**: Time interval used (1m, 5m, 1h, etc.)
- **Signal type**: LONG or SHORT
- **Profit/Loss**: Percentage gain/loss
  - Green text if profit
  - Red text if loss
- **Remove button**: Delete this strategy

### Chart Display

```
      5% ┤
         │  ╱GREEN LINE (LONG profit)
      0% ┼━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ (Y=0 baseline)
         │       ╲BLUE LINE (average)
     -5% ┤          ╲RED LINE (LONG loss)
```

All lines start from Y=0 and diverge based on performance.

## 🧪 Example Usage Scenario

**User wants to compare 1h vs 4h LONG strategies for cbBTC:**

1. Navigate to "Strategies" view
2. Select token: cbBTC
3. Set time range: 1D
4. Add first strategy:
   - Interval: 1h
   - Signal: LONG
   - Result: +2.5% (green line)
5. Add second strategy:
   - Interval: 4h
   - Signal: LONG
   - Result: +3.8% (green line)
6. Chart shows:
   - Both green lines starting from Y=0
   - 4h line higher (better performance)
   - Blue average line at ~3.15%

**User adds a SHORT strategy that failed:**

7. Add third strategy:
   - Interval: 1h
   - Signal: SHORT
   - Result: -2.5% (red line, because price increased)
8. Chart now shows:
   - Two green lines (profitable LONG)
   - One red line (unprofitable SHORT)
   - Blue average line adjusted to ~1.27%

## 🎯 Color Logic Explanation

### LONG Signal
**Logic:** Profit when price increases

```typescript
percentChange = ((currentPrice - firstPrice) / firstPrice) * 100;

if (percentChange > 0) {
  color = GREEN; // Price increased = profit
} else {
  color = RED;   // Price decreased = loss
}
```

**Example:**
- Entry: $100
- Exit: $110
- Change: +10% ✅ GREEN

### SHORT Signal
**Logic:** Profit when price decreases (inverted)

```typescript
percentChange = ((firstPrice - currentPrice) / firstPrice) * 100;

if (percentChange > 0) {
  color = GREEN; // Price decreased = profit
} else {
  color = RED;   // Price increased = loss
}
```

**Example:**
- Entry: $100
- Exit: $90
- Change: +10% ✅ GREEN (price went down, short profits)

**Important:** SHORT graphs are still drawn from Y=0 upward using absolute percentage values. Only the color logic is inverted.

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Interval Comparison
**Question:** "Is 1h or 4h better for LONG strategy?"

**Process:**
1. Add 1h LONG strategy
2. Add 4h LONG strategy
3. Compare green lines on chart
4. Higher line = better performance

### 2. Signal Type Testing
**Question:** "Should I go LONG or SHORT on this token?"

**Process:**
1. Add 1h LONG strategy
2. Add 1h SHORT strategy
3. Compare which is green (profit)
4. Choose signal type with better performance

### 3. Multi-Interval Analysis
**Question:** "What's the overall trend across different timeframes?"

**Process:**
1. Add multiple intervals (1m, 5m, 1h, 4h)
2. All with LONG signal
3. Look at historical average (blue line)
4. Positive average = bullish, Negative = bearish

### 4. Risk Assessment
**Question:** "Which interval has most stable returns?"

**Process:**
1. Add same signal across multiple intervals
2. Compare line volatility on chart
3. Less volatile line = more stable
4. Choose based on risk tolerance
